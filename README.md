# 🎟️ Token-Gated Membership Store

A smart contract that enables exclusive, tier-based membership access using ERC-20 tokens as a gate. Users can purchase different membership tiers based on their token holdings and pay the corresponding fee in ETH.

## 📝 Project Description

This project implements a decentralized membership system where access is gated based on users holding a minimum amount of a specified ERC-20 token. Membership is categorized into tiers such as Bronze, Silver, and Gold, each requiring a specific token balance and ETH payment. It's ideal for creators, DAOs, or platforms looking to incentivize or monetize token holding.

## 🌟 Project Vision
